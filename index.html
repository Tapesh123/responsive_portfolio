             Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio Page! Here you can learn more about my interests and short term goals. Currently, I work
            in the healthcare field but soon I will be transitioning in to the Web development industry! My passion for learning computer
            programming stems from childhood as I used to play around with an ancient programming tool called qBasic. This lasting interest
            and the joy I get from building something from scratch gives me the best feeling!
            </p>
            
            <p>On this page you will see the links to my upcoming Portfolio projects and my contact information. The portfolio will consists
                of all my projects and skills. Here you will find different type of projects I have worked on independently and group
                members from Rutgers BootCamp!</p>

            <p>For fun activites, I love to spend time with my wife, watch Marvel movies and 90's classic movies, research companies and
                stocks to invest in, read nutritional/fitness articles and learn to get better at coding! Coding has become a great interest
                for me and with enough experience and practice hopefully start doing freelance work and get a full time at position at a nice big fortune 500 company!
            
            <p>In terms of sports, I love snowboarding during the winter season, preferably snowboard in Vermont where the snow is soft!
                During spring and summer months I love to go swimming and play basketball. Going to the gym and lifting weights is another
                area that appeals to me. Working and learning how to code can get overwhelming so I must release my stress by hitting
                the gym!</p>
